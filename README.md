# 🎯 Extra Tips (very important)

- Don’t try to learn EVERYTHING → focus on _core fundamentals_
    
- Speak out loud while solving problems (interviewers love clarity)
    
- Write clean, readable Python code
    
- Sleep well before the interview days
    
- Don't spend too much time on very advanced algorithms — they don't expect that
